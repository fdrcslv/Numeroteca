# Numeroteca

Simple static app for the Numeroteca game.

Check it here https://fdrcslv.github.io/Numeroteca/

## 1. Games.json
Games.json is the static file that contains all the information needed by the app to play a round of Numeroteca. 
One game needs:

* the number to be guessed
* the array of questions that the app will ask to the audience (discussed in point 2)

The games are divided by difficulty level:

* easy
* medium
* hard

Every game level has a set of numbers to choose from.

The structure of the json is this:

```
{
  easy:{
    numbers:[2,3,"rad2",1024,"pi"...],
    games:[
      {
        current:11,
        questions:["is_odd","is_miltiple_of(5)"...]
      },
      {
        current:6,
        questions:[...]
      }
      {
        current: 9,
        questions:[...]
      }
    ]
  },
  meedium:{
    numbers:[...],
    games:[

    ]
  },
  hard:{
    numbers:[...],
    games:[...]
  }
}

```
## 2. Questions

### 2.1 Supported Questions
These are the currentl√≤y suported questions, for integers, decimal, fractions, and "superstar" numbers like Pi etc.

* is_irrational()
* is_algebric()
* is_transcendental()
* is_fraction()
* is_odd()
* is_multiple_of(n)
* contains_digit(n)
* has_length(n)
* has_length_or_more(n)
* has_sign(n) [plus sign passed as 1, minus sign as -1]
* is_integer()
* is_palindrome()
* is_lesser_than(n)
* is_platonic()
* is_perfect()
* is_power_of(n)
* is_fibonacci()
* is_prime()
* is_decimal()
* is_binary()
* is_made_of_n_digits_equal(n)

### 2.2 Question formatting in games.json
To instruct the app to ask a question, just pick a question from the list and write it in the ```questions``` list parameter of the game. If
a question needs am additional parameter (i.e. is_multiple_of) the string will be 

```"is_multiple_of(11)"```


If the question doesn't need a parameter (i.e. is_irrational), just write ```"is_irrational"``` in the list of questions.

### 2.2.1 Example of questions for the number 11

```
"current":11,
        "questions":[
          "is_multiple_of(3)",
          "is_multiple_of(5)",
          "is_odd",
          "contains_digit(1)",
          "has_length(2)",
          "is_made_of_n_digits_equal(2)"
        ]
```
## 3. Superstar Numbers

The special numbers supported are:

* pi
* e
* phi
* root2

Also fractions (like 1/2) need a special treatment since their representation is different from their value. The question "contains_digit(2)" for 1/2 is true for its representation, but not for its value.

## 4. Images
File names for the number cards are the same as the number they represent: 1.jpg for the number 1 and pi.jpg for Pi.

In some cases we follow two simple rules of substitution:

Numbers like 0.4 map to a filename like 04.jpeg

Numbers like 1/2 map to a filename formatted as 1over2.jpeg
